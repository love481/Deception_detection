# Random forest classifier model
It is based on creating the random_forest_classifier model using Actions units as inputs and deception label as output. The liars shows certain kind of facial expressions enabling Action units which is unusual in case of truth speakers. We have used the AI model(comments in the code) to detect the Action units on the real-life-trial datasets and based on the label data built the proposed classifier.
