# Emotion detection based on decision tree
The decision tree is implemented on Box-of-lies datasets to detect one of the emotions from list ('neutral' 'other' 'smile' 'laughter' 'scowl' 'None') based on the Action unit sets corresponding to each unique facial parts i.e ('Eyebrows', 'Eyes', 'Gaze', 'Mouth_Openess','Mouth_Lips'). Each facial parts consists of one or more Action unit labels used for multi class emotions. Each csv file contains different information related to facial analysis, head movement analysis, deception labels and so on.
